# Data-Analysis-Visualisation-for-ProwiseLearn

This project explores factors influencing students’ feedback-viewing time on the Prowise Learn platform. The goal was to identify which variables shape how long students spend reviewing their feedback and to create clear, interpretable visualizations to support data-driven insights.

## Project Overview
The analysis was completed in R using a full data-analysis workflow:
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, filtering, handling missing values)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions, relationships, and trends
- Visualisation using ggplot2 to highlight patterns in students’ feedback-viewing time
- Reporting via an HTML-knitted RMarkdown file for clear and reproducible communication


## Files
- index.html – knitted HTML report (viewable on GitHub Pages)
- DV_ProwiseLearn.Rmd – main RMarkdown analysis file
- README.md – project description

## Technologies used
- R, RMarkdown
- tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr)
- ggplot2
- knit
